#### SkyNasMk1.
## Scroll down to view the disclaimer and Legal Notice
SkyNasMk1 is a Linux-based Network Attached Storage (NAS) server built on top of Debian/Ubuntu. It utilizes Webmin as a dashboard for easy management and Samba for networking protocol, with the ability to configure RAID.

## Features

- **Webmin Dashboard**: A user-friendly web interface for managing your NAS server.
- **Samba Networking Protocol**: Share files across different systems seamlessly.
- **RAID Configuration**: Enhance storage reliability and performance with RAID setup.
- **Linux-Based**: Built on the stable and versatile Debian/Ubuntu Linux distributions.

## Requirements

- A computer with Debian/Ubuntu installed.
- An internet connection for installing necessary packages.
- Basic knowledge of Linux command-line operations.

## Installation

**Note**: It is recommended that you use the manual process instead of the automated script, as it (the automated script) may not allow you to edit certain settings during installation.

### Step 1: OS Updates and Upgrades

Update your system to ensure all packages are current:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

### Step 2: Setting Up a Static IP Address

1. Edit the network interfaces file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
   ```

2. Add the following:

   ```plaintext
   iface eth0 inet static
       address 192.168.1.190
       network 192.168.1.0
       netmask 255.255.255.0
       broadcast 192.168.1.255
       gateway 192.168.1.1
       dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
   ```

### Step 3: SSH Access

SSH into your server:

```bash
ssh user@192.168.1.190
```

### Step 4: Installing Webmin

For more information, visit [Webmin](https://webmin.com).

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y libapt-pkg-perl libnet-ssleay-perl libauthen-pam-perl libio-pty-perl apt-show-versions
   ```

2. Download and install Webmin:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/webadmin/webmin_1.580_all.deb
   sudo dpkg -i webmin*.deb
   sudo reboot
   ```

### Step 5: Setting Up RAID

1. Install the RAID management tool:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y mdadm
   ```

2. Create mount directories:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/raidmount /mnt/disk1 /media/disk1
   ```

3. Identify the disk UUID:

   ```bash
   sudo blkid
   ```

4. Edit the `/etc/fstab` file to mount the disk at boot:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```

   Add the following line (replace `"ID From blkid"` with the actual UUID):

   ```plaintext
   UUID="ID From blkid" /media/disk1 ext4 rw,user,auto 0 0
   ```

### Step 6: Access Webmin

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```url
https://192.168.1.190:10000
```

Log in using your system credentials.

### Step 7: Creating Shared Folders

1. Create the folder:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /media/raidmount/folder_1
   ```

### Step 8: Setting Permissions

1. For Read/Write access for one user:

   ```bash
   sudo chown user:user /media/raidmount/folder_1
   ```

2. For Read/Write access for everyone:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod a=rw -R /media/raidmount
   sudo chown nobody:nogroup /media/raidmount/folder_1
   ```

### Step 9: Setting Up Samba

1. Backup the old config file:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.old
   ```

2. Edit the Samba config file with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   #======================= Global Settings =======================
   [global]
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   load printers = no
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n
   *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   null passwords = yes
   map to guest = Bad User
   encrypt passwords = yes
   passdb backend = tdbsam
   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   dns proxy = no
   server string = %h server (Samba, Ubuntu)
   unix password sync = yes
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   debug level = 1
   guest account = nobody
   os level = 20
   auto services = global
   syslog = 0
   usershare allow guests = yes
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panicÂ­action %d
   max log size = 1000
   pam password change = yes
   use sendfile = yes
   time server = no
   wins support = no

   #======================= Share Definitions =======================
   [homes]
   browseable = no
   comment = Home Directories
   available = no

   [Folder1]
   read list = nobody,user
   write list = user, add nobody here for passwordless read/write access
   force directory mode = 0755
   store dos attributes = no
   create mask = 0755
   hide dot files = yes
   user = nobody,user
   public = yes
   ea support = no
   inherit acls = yes
   browseable = yes
   writeable = yes
   inherit permissions = yes
   printable = no
   path = /media/raiddisk/Folder1
   force create mode = 0755
   comment = Folder 1
   directory mask = 0755
   valid users = nobody,user
   ```

3. Restart Samba services.

## Automated Installation Script

**Note**: It is recommended that you use the manual process instead of the automated script, as it (the automated script) may not allow you to edit certain settings during installation.

Save the following script as `install_sky_nas.sh` and make it executable:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# OS Updates And Upgrades
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
sudo reboot

# Setting Up A Static IP Address
sudo bash -c 'cat <<EOF >> /etc/network/interfaces
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.190
    network 192.168.1.0
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 192.168.1.255
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
EOF'

sudo dpkg -i webmin*.deb
sudo reboot

# Setting up RAID
sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install -y mdadm
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/raidmount /mnt/disk1 /media/disk1

sudo bash -c 'cat <<EOF >> /etc/fstab
UUID="ID From blkid" /media/disk1 ext4 rw,user,auto 0 0
EOF'

# Creating Shared Folders
sudo mkdir -p /media/raidmount/folder_1

# Permissions

# Setting up Samba
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.old
